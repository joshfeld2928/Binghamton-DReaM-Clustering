# Binghamton-DReaM-Clustering

This Jupyter Notebook shows the Clustering analysis work I did for the SUNY Binghamton Decision Research and Modeling (DReaM) Lab during the Summer of 2024. 

De-identified data was collected from around 200 college students via an online survey. Students were asked to rate their trust (on a scale from one to one-hundred) on how much they trusted online message boards (MBs), chatbots (CBs), and people to answer questions about their lives. Question categories were as follows: career, education, family, finances, relationships, relocation, and self-develop.

The notebook is organized into sections with comments. The first section is Exploratory Analysis where I do my own brief analysis and exploration of the data. After that the clustering starts and is organized into three different sections, one for MBs, CBs, and people. My own comments on results of the analysis are also scattered throughout.
